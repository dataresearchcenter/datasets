# Development

We are happy to add more datasources to the catalog. Here are a few lines about the involved technology.

This project is build upon [investigraph](https://investigraph.dev), an etl framework for [Follow The Money](https://followthemoney.tech) data written in python.

Head over to the [investigraph documentation](https://docs.investigraph.dev) to learn how the framework works.

Depending on the source data, adding a new dataset might involve some python coding knowledge.

Check out the [datasets folder](https://github.com/investigativedata/investigraph-eu/tree/main/datasets) in our repo to get examples for the existing datasets.

Happy scraping!
