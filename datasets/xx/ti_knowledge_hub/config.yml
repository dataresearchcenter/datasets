  Scraped from the TI Knowledge Hub (aka "Anti-Corruption Helpdesk")

  The Anti-Corruption Helpdesk meets the professional knowledge and research
  needs of a variety of stakeholders, providing timely and tailored responses to
  corruption-related enquiries.

  Questions are answered within ten working days in the form of short briefings,
  drawing on the knowledge of Transparency International’s global network of
  anti-corruption experts and practitioners.

  Each answer provides a synthesis of the state of research on a particular
  topic, lessons learned from case studies as well as practical recommendations
  for anti-corruption approaches.

  Topics cover a wide range of corruption-related issues, from the effectiveness
  of anti-corruption agencies, to tackling corruption in post-conflict
  situations, to recent trends in anti-bribery laws.
