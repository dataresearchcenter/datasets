summary: |
  The Transparency Register is a public database listing interest
  representatives (organisations, formal or informal groups, associations or
  networks, self-employed individuals) that carry out activities to influence
  the EU law or policy-making or the decision-making processes of the EU
  institutions. It is designed to show what interests are being represented at
  EU level, by whom and on whose behalf – and the resources devoted to such
  interest representation activities (including financial support and
  sponsorship).
