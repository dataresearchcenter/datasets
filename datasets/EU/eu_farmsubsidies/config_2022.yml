summary: |
  Farm subsidies are EU payments to public authorities, companies and farmers
  who are active in the agricultural sector and/or contribute to its
  maintenance. Subsidies are financed by taxpayers' money, primarily through
  the EU, but the Member States also contribute financially in a direct way.
  Subsidies are part of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which came
  into force in 1962. All the data presented on this website has either been
  published directly by EU country governments, or obtained from them by
  freedom of information requests.
