  The Corporate Prosecution Registry is a joint project of the Legal Data Lab
  at the University of Virginia School of Law and Duke University School of
  Law. The goal of this Corporate Prosecution Registry is to provide
  comprehensive and up-to-date information on federal organizational
  prosecutions in the United States, so that we can better understand how
  corporate prosecutions are brought and resolved. We include detailed
  information about every federal organizational prosecution since 2001, as
  well as deferred and non-prosecution agreements with organizations since
  1990.
