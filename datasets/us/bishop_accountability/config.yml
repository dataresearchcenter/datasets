  BishopAccountability.org is a digital and brick-and-mortar archive of the
  Catholic clergy abuse crisis; the staff also does basic research. We establish
  assignment histories of accused clergy and religious, maintain a database of
  accused, and track the lists of accused that the dioceses and religious orders
  have published. Our Database of Accused in the United States comprises more
  than 7,300 records as of September 30, 2021.
